# Our server use Flask as controller to build API endpoints
# The database we used is MySQL Lite
# The auth process between this server and the mobile app is by using JWT token
# The server is deployed in our physical linux server at my home (I have config port forwarding, nginx, systemctl, gunicorn for load balancing and dynu as dynamic dns)
# Domain: boxgateway.kozow.com

# For news data:
# Here we should get space news from an space organization or some where else
# But here this just simulate the news data (stored it in json file) and it only response these whenever calling this endpoint (the data response will not change)
